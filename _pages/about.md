I am a machine learning engineer at Institute of Artificial Intelligence, China Telecom (TeleAI) in Beijing, where I'm working on Controllable Text-to-Video Generation. I received my Bachelor's degree in Wuhan University in 2022. After that, I received my Master's degree at [AIM Lab](aim-nercms.whu.edu.cn), [National Engineering Research Center for Multimedia Software (NERCMS)](multimedia.whu.edu.cn), [Wuhan University](www.whu.edu.cn), where I was supervised by [Prof. Zheng Wang](https://wangzwhu.github.io/home/). My research interests include Recommender Systems, Multi-modal Information Retrieval, and Text-to-Video Generation. I have also served as a reviewer of multiple conferences and journals, including ACM MM, TCSVT, and ICML.
